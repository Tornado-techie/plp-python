# File Read & Write Challenge

## Description

This project is a simple command-line program that demonstrates file reading, writing, and error handling in file operations.  It takes a filename as input from the user, reads the content of that file, modifies the content (e.g., reverses the lines), and writes the modified content to a new file with a different name.

This project addresses the following:

*   **File Input/Output (I/O):** Reading the contents of an existing text file.
*   **File Manipulation:** Modifying the content read from the file (the specific modification will be defined in your implementation, e.g. reversing lines).
*   **File Creation:** Creating a new text file and writing modified content to it.
*   **Error Handling:** Implementing robust error handling for scenarios like invalid filenames, non-existent files, and file permission issues.
*   **User Input:** Getting the filename from the user via the command line.

## Setup

1.  **Prerequisites:**

    *   [Specify any language runtime dependencies here.  E.g., Python 3.6 or higher]
    *   [Specify any libraries to install]
        e.g.  `pip install some_library`
2.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone [your repository URL]
    cd [your repository directory]
    ```

3.  **[Optional] Create a virtual environment (recommended):**

    ```bash
    # Example using Python
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Linux/macOS
    venv\Scripts\activate  # On Windows
    ```

4.  **Install dependencies (if any):**

    ```bash
    # Example using Python
    pip install -r requirements.txt # If you have a requirements.txt file
    ```

## Usage

1.  **Run the program:**

    ```bash
    # Example:  Adapt this based on your language
    python main.py
    # or
    ./my_program
    # or
    java -jar my_program.jar
    ```

2.  **Follow the prompts:**

    The program will prompt you to enter the name of the file you want to process.

    ```
    Enter the filename:  input.txt
    ```

3.  **Output:**

    *   If the file is read successfully and the modification and writing are successful, a new file will be created (e.g., `output.txt`, or `modified_input.txt`) containing the modified content.
    *   The program will print messages indicating success or failure and provide specific error messages.

## Error Handling

The program includes error handling for the following scenarios:

*   **File Not Found:** If the specified file does not exist, the program will display an appropriate error message and exit gracefully.
*   **Permission Errors:** If the program does not have the necessary permissions to read the file or write to the specified output location, an error message will be displayed.
*   **Invalid Filename:**  The program may include basic validation to check for invalid characters in the filename.
*   **[Add any other specific error handling you implemented here, e.g., file too large]**

**Example Error Scenarios:**

*   **File Not Found:**
    ```
    Enter the filename:  nonexistent_file.txt
    Error: File not found: nonexistent_file.txt
    ```

*   **Permission Error:**
    ```
    Enter the filename:  /root/protected_file.txt  # Assuming user doesn't have access
    Error: Permission denied to read file: /root/protected_file.txt
    ```

## Modification Logic

The core logic for modifying the file content is [Explain here what modification you perform on the file.  Examples:]

*   Reversing the order of the lines.
*   Converting all text to uppercase.
*   Replacing specific words or characters.
*   Adding line numbers to each line.
*   [Anything you implement]

This logic is implemented in the function `[function name or class name, if applicable]` located in `[file name]`.

## Potential Improvements

*   **More Sophisticated Modifications:** Implement more complex file manipulations, such as sorting lines alphabetically, removing duplicate lines, or performing search and replace operations using regular expressions.
*   **Command-Line Arguments:**  Accept input and output filenames as command-line arguments instead of prompting the user.  This makes the program more scriptable.
*   **Configuration File:**  Use a configuration file to specify settings such as the modification type and output filename format.
*   **More Robust Error Handling:** Add more specific error handling for different types of file I/O exceptions.
*   **Unit Tests:** Write unit tests to ensure the program's functionality and error handling are working correctly.
*   **Progress Indicator:**  For large files, display a progress indicator to show the user how much of the file has been processed.
*   **GUI:** Develop a graphical user interface (GUI) for the program.
