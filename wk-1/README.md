# Basic Calculator Program

This Python program is a simple command-line calculator that performs basic arithmetic operations.  It takes two numbers and an operator as input from the user and then displays the result of the calculation.


## Introduction

This project provides a basic calculator that allows users to perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division operations. It's a great starting point for learning about user input, conditional statements, and basic arithmetic in Python.

## Features

*   Performs addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
*   Takes user input for numbers and operator.
*   Provides clear output of the calculation.
*   Handles potential division by zero errors.

## Installation

1.  Make sure you have Python installed on your system.  
2.  Clone this repository to your local machine:
    ```bash
    git clone <repository_url>  
    cd basic-calculator
    ```

3.  (Optional) Create a virtual environment:
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Linux/macOS
    venv\Scripts\activate   # On Windows
    ```

## Usage
1.  Navigate to the project directory in your terminal.
2.  Run the Python script:

    ```bash
    python calculator.py
    ```
    
3.  The program will prompt you to enter the first number, the second number, and the desired operator.  Follow the prompts and enter the appropriate values.
## Example
1. Enter the first number: 10 Enter the second number: 5 Enter the operator (+, -, *, /): + 10.0 + 5.0 = 15.0
2. Enter the first number: 20 Enter the second number: 2 Enter the operator (+, -, *, /): / 20.0 / 2.0 = 10.0

## Code Structure
The project consists of a single Python file:
*   `calculator.py`:  This file contains the main program logic, including functions for getting user input, performing calculations, and displaying the results.
